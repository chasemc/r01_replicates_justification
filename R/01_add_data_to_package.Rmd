This part isn't needed to replicate result but is a trace of how the .7z raw data archive was created

This requires 7zip to be installed. It can be found here: https://www.7-zip.org
```{r}

path_to_7zip_executable <- "C:/Program Files/7-Zip/7z"

path_to_write <- file.path(here(), "data", fsep = "/")


uncompressed_data <- "C:/Users/chase/Downloads/1-18-19"

cmd <- paste0(shQuote(path_to_7zip_executable),
              " a",
              " -mx9 ",
              
              shQuote(file.path(path_to_write,
                                "raw_data",
                                fsep = "/")),
              " ",
              shQuote(uncompressed_data))

system(cmd, intern = TRUE)

```
